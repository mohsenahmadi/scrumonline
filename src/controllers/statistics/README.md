# Scrum Poker Statistics
This directory contains statistics of the session. Each statistic is implemented by a dedicated implementation of the `IStatistic` interface.
Create new plugins by navigating to the directory and running:

```sh
$ bash generate-plugin.sh PluginName
```

Make sure to provide a meaningful comment on top of the class, because the application links directly to the source file from the UI.
